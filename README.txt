Assignment 3 CS349 By: Pablo Salazar 20373596

Sketch n' Play!!!

The three modes are located at the very top (Draw, Erase, Select)

You can either run the program by typing 'make' in the commandline, or open it through eclipse (just in case something went wrong with the make)

There is a Play and Stop button at the bottom, I'm sure you know what they do :)
The '|<' button will bring you to the beginning of the animation
The '>|' button will bring you to the end of the animation

The '+' button can be used when you are at the end of the animation to add 1 second of still time. (Alternate implementation to the hold ctrl as described in the assignment description.)

UML Diagram of my program is saved as a jpeg named MVC_UML.jpg

ENHANCEMENTS

Colours to use when drawing.

Restart Button to clear the current animation and start a new one.

Load and Save button! You can store 1 animation by pressing save and you can play it again after either pressing restart, or closing the program by pressing load. (Saving an animation will over-write the old saved one; it was a last minute enhancement so I did not have enough time to implement multiple saved animations)

PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING WITH THE PROGRAM:
I have saved a short little stupid demo for the marker. As soon as you open the program press load and play :)

Enjoy!!
